I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Montpellier (France) in 2012 with a thesis on nonequilibrium phase transitions. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Luxembourg (2012-14), working on crystallisation and nonequilibrium surface tension. I was then a Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Bristol (2014-2023), working on glasses, gels, and active and biological matter. From 2024, I am Lecturer in Scientific Computing at the School of Physics, University of Bristol.

I am interested in nonequilibrium, disordered systems. Using theoretical and numerical tools, I investigate heterogeneous disordered media and active matter. My focus is on emergent properties, collective behaviour, and spatial structure in various systems, from glasses to animals, from gels to bones.
